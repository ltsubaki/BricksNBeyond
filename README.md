# BricksNBeyond Website

## Description
A fictitious client, Aurora Brickwell, approached our team with a couple of issues. Aurora owned a small business selling unique Lego sets that she designed. 
She wanted to migrate her online store from disorganized social media accounts to an actual e-commerce website.
She also was experiencing an influx of fraudulent orders and wanted a way to sort through these potential fraudulent orders.
We designed an aesthetic Lego website that uses data processed through MLR pipelines to predict whether an order would be fraudulent or not.
We also implemented basic security features, including role-based authentication, dual-factor authentication, third-party authentication, and cookies.
Aurora also wanted our website to display recommendations based on previous purchases a customer made, or general recommendations if it was a new user.
We processed purchasing data through an MLR pipeline to create recommendations for individual users to hopefully increase sales.
